# Mérou - A helper for quickly creating new C++ projects

## Overview

Many programming languages come with full featured tools for creating and managing projects written in these languages.
Some examples are Mix for Elixir, Rebar(3) for Erlang, Cabal for Haskell, SBT for Scala.
If one isn't using an IDE, setting up a new C++ project is a bit more involved.

Mérou aims to simplify this: it provides a simple C++ project skeleton that can easily be configured and extended.
The base features provided by the skeleton should be:

+ CMake based project configuration
+ Dummy files for app, library parts of the code
+ Unit tests already set up
+ Travis integration
